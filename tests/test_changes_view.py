Pins the things that make this page honest rather than merely populated: that
a criterion with no evidence behind it says so instead of claiming a change,
that the two speed paths are never confused (writing the absolute ramp onto an
authored-speed bot destroys the scenario), that the before/after is READ from
the two .sce files rather than reconstructed, and that the page never touches
the model it is reporting on.
