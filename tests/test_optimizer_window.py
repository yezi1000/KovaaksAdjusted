"""Optimizer window layout (offscreen QPA).

The window is four stacked group boxes, and the one the window exists for —
System checkup, a twelve-row list of probes and Fix buttons — opened as a
79px slot. Two of the four boxes carry no stretch factor, so their full
sizeHint comes off the top before the stretch factors divide anything, and
110px of the watchdog's was a read-only log pane that had never logged
anything. The un-stretched box ended up TALLER than the stretch-3 one.
