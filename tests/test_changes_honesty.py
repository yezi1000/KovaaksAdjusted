"""gui/changes_view.py: the page may not show a number, verdict or claim its
own files do not support, and two surfaces may not contradict each other about
the same thing.

Every case here was first found by RENDERING the page and reading the picture,
so each test names the lie it pins shut:

  * a fabricated speed baseline (1.0x / 0.0 hard-coded) driving the headline
  * `speed_path` collapsing a mixed scenario, so the ladder claimed the
    absolute ramp is "never written here" above a ledger row showing it written
  * "@" living at index 0 of the run ramp, the same glyph as the marker, so a
    long run rendered "|@@@@#####...@" with four @s of which one was the value
  * the marker test running before the anchor test, so an unmoved criterion drew
    a lone "@" and no baseline tick at all
  * a movement rail starting at min_movement (0.35) while plotting the 0.15
    dataclass default, printing one number and painting another
  * size_check ignoring `plan.fatigue`, calling every eased variant stale
  * the spawn grid painting maximum density for a layout the generator provably
    left alone, one line above the knob saying so
  * the Fitts clause appended on the observation count alone
  * "N criteria have moved" over a ledger whose every VARIANT cell was a dash
  * a rail below ~800px rendering a real -20% move as "@|"
