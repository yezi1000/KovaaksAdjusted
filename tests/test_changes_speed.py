"""gui/changes_view.py: the ladder, the ledger and the provenance line have to
agree about TARGET SPEED, and none of them may present a number the two .sce
files do not carry.

Every case here was first found by RENDERING the page and reading it back:

  * on a fatigue-eased variant the ladder read "TARGET SPEED (X AUTHORED)
    1.00 -> 1.03x  +3%" while the file ledger in the same section read
    "char1 - MaxSpeed  1300 -> 1182  x0.909". Both are computed from the same
    variant; the ladder was reading the un-eased MODEL and the ledger the eased
    FILE. On one render the two disagreed about the direction of the change
    (+17% against x1.00), and the ladder's number was counted in the headline's
    "4 of 5 criteria have moved on evidence".
  * the provenance line echoed the variant's Description header verbatim, which
    always carries `speed=<absolute 0-170 ramp>` — a figure never written on a
    scenario whose targets author a MaxSpeed of their own, because the generator
    took the multiplier path per character. Echoing a stored string is not
    evidence that its numbers landed, and ARCHITECTURE.md is emphatic that writing the
    ramp onto a strafe bot collapses the scenario.
  * the cold-start note on that same row read "…but the file already carries
    this number" one line under a headline saying "there is no [Adaptive] file
    on disk yet" and over a ledger whose every VARIANT cell was a dash.
  * read_sce_facts gives up on a missing base .sce before it ever looks at the
    variant, so a task whose base file had been renamed printed "no [Adaptive]
    .sce on disk carries this value" — four notes and one headline — about a
    file sitting right beside the one it could not find.
