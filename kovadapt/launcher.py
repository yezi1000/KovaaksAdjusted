"""Launch integration: start KovaaK's and jump into adaptive tasks from the app.

kovadapt never modifies or redistributes the game — integration goes through
surfaces Valve and the game officially sanction for external tools:

  * **Deep links** (KovaaK's 3.0.0+, verified present in the 3.9.x binary):
    ``steam://run/824270//?action=jump-to-scenario&name=<encoded>&mode=challenge``
    loads the game directly into a scenario. Steam delivers the query params
    via the Steamworks API, so the same URL works cold (Steam boots the game
    into the scenario) and warm (the running instance jumps in place).
  * **Steam's browser protocol** launches the game exactly like the library
    button does. Steam itself enforces ownership and DRM, so this doubles as
    the "you actually own KovaaK's" check: without an owning, logged-in
    account the game simply won't start.
  * **The game's user-editable save files** (``Saved/SaveGames/Playlists``)
    queue scenarios as a local playlist — the same JSON the in-game playlist
    editor writes (picked up at next game start).

Everything here is stdlib (+ optional psutil for the running-game probe) and
imports cleanly on any OS; probes degrade to False off-Windows.

    there before a cold boot may make the game resume it without any menu
    clicks. Never runs while the game is open (it rewrites the file at
    runtime).

    The backups are the entire safety story, since this replaces a file the
    game owns, so both of them exist for a reason:

    * ``.kovadapt.bak`` keeps the oldest genuine original — but it only
      counts as taken once it holds real bytes. The game leaves
      PlaylistInProgress.json empty between playlists, and a one-shot backup
      taken then froze 0 bytes in as "the original"; every later staging
      afterwards destroyed a real in-progress playlist with nothing to
      restore from. (Observed in the wild: a 0-byte .kovadapt.bak next to a
      live file.)
    * ``.kovadapt.prev.bak`` keeps whatever *this* write is replacing, so the
      bytes about to be destroyed always survive somewhere.

    Our own staging is recognised by its CONTENT MARKER, not by byte
    identity. Byte identity was the original test and it was broken by
    construction: `write_playlist` stamps `"updated": int(time.time())`, so
    any two Play clicks more than a second apart produce different bytes. The
    second staging therefore judged kovadapt's own file to be the user's,
    rotated it over `.kovadapt.prev.bak` — which held the copy of their
    genuine PlaylistInProgress.json — and the one-shot `.kovadapt.bak` did
    not save them either, because that slot frequently latches our own
    payload (the game leaves the file empty between playlists, so click 1
    writes no backup and click 2 freezes our bytes in as "the original").
    The genuine bytes then existed in no file on disk while the app reported
    that it had staged safely.

    Both failure directions of the marker are safe: content we cannot parse,
    or that carries someone else's author, is treated as the user's and gets
    backed up; a copy the game has annotated with progress still carries
    ours.
