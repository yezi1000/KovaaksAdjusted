"""Character-art data viz: the Analysis charts drawn as glyph matrices in
the ascii_art visual language (monospace glyphs, density ramps, LED color)
instead of pyqtgraph. pyqtgraph survives only inside TrajectoryReplay.

These three are LEGIBLE first and decorative second — the standing complaint
was that no value could be read off any of them:

    AsciiBars     one constant-pitch track per bar: filled cells, a HARD tip
                  rule at the exact value, the unfilled remainder left as a
                  faint dotted rule so the scale stays visible, the numerals
                  in their own right-hand column (never over the track), and a
                  0..max ruler under the rows. The old glyph run faded
                  '@' -> '.' along its length, so 0.22 and 0.24 differed by
                  one dissolving character and the chart could not be compared
                  at all. The footer ratio is OPT-IN (see ratio_footer).
    AsciiHeatmap  a zone lattice (Settings.region_cols x region_rows) with
                  position words on both axes in the app's one region
                  vocabulary (analysis.insights._region_words, the wording the
                  Coach uses on the same screen), each measured zone's value
                  printed on it, unmeasured zones drawn hollow and COUNTED in
                  the footer, and a colour key only when the data's range
                  really does map to distinguishable colour. The r{row}c{col}
                  keys are the engine contract, not user-facing text: they
                  live on hover.
    AsciiTrend    a CONNECTED glyph line (slope glyphs plus vertical risers)
                  over a dim mean rule, with first/min/max/newest marked and
                  a run axis underneath. Unconnected marks at 1400px read as
                  a dot field with no baseline, which left the title carrying
                  all of the meaning and the graph none. Two runs draw as a
                  SEGMENT between two marked points, and a spread too small to
                  be a shape draws FLAT — on one row, with the mean rule ON it.
                  The axis names an absolute run number only when the caller
                  states the offset: it is handed a WINDOW of the history
                  (history[-60:]) and cannot know the index it starts at.

Nothing here may draw a claim its data cannot carry, and no two parts of one
panel may disagree. Three rules earn their own machinery:

    * a microstructure sentence (the bars' ratio) needs the caller's
      input-health verdict, so it is opt-in and gated on sample size;
    * a y axis printing the same number at both ends, or a hairline spread
      stretched into an oscillation, is a lie about movement — hence
      AsciiTrend._y_range's span floor;
    * a colour key is a promise that colour maps to number, so it appears
      only when its own endpoints differ visibly — and a lattice whose whole
      spread is narrower than one ramp step is drawn uniformly FAINT rather
      than stretched, however far from zero it sits.

All three are pure QPainter and keep only their data: they read
theme.current() at paint time, so restyle() is nothing but update() — never
cache a palette. Grid row 0 is the BOTTOM row everywhere (aim convention,
+y up), matching the r{row}c{col} region-key contract.

Motion comes from gui/motion.py and nowhere else. New data IGNITES: cells
light in a wave staggered by DISTANCE from a meaningful origin (the weakest
zone, the bars' zero anchor, the newest run), and the heatmap answers a hover
with a ring rippling outward. Both are quantized to a character ramp, so both
run at motion.GLYPH_HZ; both are skipped entirely when motion is off. The one
timer per widget ticks only while the widget is VISIBLE and something is
actually in flight — an idle chart schedules nothing.
