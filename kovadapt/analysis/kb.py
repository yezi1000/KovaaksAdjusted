"""Cited aim-training knowledge base.

Distilled from primary sources by a cited research workflow; produced 2026-07-28. The source
base: motor-control literature (Fitts 1954; Guadagnoli & Lee 2004; Donovan & Radosevich 1999;
Walker et al. 2002; Adams 1961; Casiez & Vogel 2008; Donovan et al. 2022; Listman et al. 2021),
Aimer7's KovaaK's guide, the Voltaic documents and benchmark sheets, Viscose benchmark sheets,
and documented pro-player practice.

Standing rule this module serves: every insight kovadapt emits must carry its reasoning and its
sources ("cite everything"). Entries marked low-confidence, contested, or extrapolated must be
surfaced as such to the player — never presented as settled fact.

Contents:

- ``PRINCIPLES`` — coaching doctrine keyed by id (topic, text, confidence, sources).
- ``DIAGNOSTICS`` — telemetry-signal playbook keyed by id (signal, condition, interpretation,
  prescription, confidence, sources). ``condition`` is the human-readable rule; the engine
  implements rules in code and references these ids.
- ``BENCHMARKS`` — rank/threshold systems (Voltaic, Viscose, Aimer7 tiers, research anchors) in
  their researched structure. Numeric thresholds live in official sheets and drift over time —
  treat them as data to re-sync (see each entry's ``accuracy_caveat``), not ground truth.
- ``ROUTINES`` — training-routine templates and documented pro session structures.
- ``GAPS`` — honest holes in the source base; anything built past these is extrapolation.

Text is preserved verbatim from the research output (coach-grade prose with inline source
attributions); only line-wrapping was adjusted. Compound confidence labels such as
"high (pattern), medium (sens attribution)" are kept verbatim — the leading token is the
primary level.

Pure data module: zero imports (``kovadapt.analysis`` is a leaf package; core install stays
numpy-only).
